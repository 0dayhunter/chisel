# chisel

Chisel is TCP proxy tunnelled over HTTP WebSockets. Similar to [crowbar](https://github.com/q3k/crowbar) though achieves **much** higher [performance](#Performance). **Warning** this is beta software.

### Install

Server

```
$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/chisel/chiseld
$ chiseld --help
```

Forwarder

```
$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/chisel/chisel-forward
```

### Demo

A Heroku app is running `chiseld` on the public HTTP port. This app
is also running a file server on 3000 (which is normally inaccessible
due to Heroku's firewall). However, if we tunnel in with:

```
$ chisel-forward --auth foobar https://chisel-demo.herokuapp.com/ 3000
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), we should
see a directory listing of this app's root.

### Usage

Both command-line programs have useful help text, see `chiseld --help` and `chisel-forward --help`.

Eventually, a programmatic API will be documented and available.

### Security

Currently, secure communications are attained by hosting your HTTP server behind a TLS proxy. Thereby upgrading your server to HTTPS. In the future, the server will allow your to pass in TLS credentials and make use of Go's TLS (HTTPS) server.

### Performance

With crowbar, I was getting extremely slow transfer times

```
#tab 1 (local file server)
$ serve -p 4000

#tab 2 (tunnel server)
$ echo -ne "foo:bar" > userfile
$ crowbard -listen="0.0.0.0:8080" -userfile=./userfile

#tab 3 (tunnel client)
$ crowbar-forward -local=0.0.0.0:3000 -server http://localhost:8080 -remote localhost:4000 -username foo -password bar

#tab 4 (transfer test)
$ time curl -s "127.0.0.1:3000/largefile.bin" > /dev/null
       74.74 real         2.37 user         6.74 sys
```

Here, `largefile.bin` (~200MB) is transferred in 1m14s (along with high CPU utilisation).

Enter `chisel`, lets swap in `chiseld` and `chisel-forward`

```
#tab 2 (tunnel server)
$ chiseld --auth foo

#tab 3 (tunnel client)
$ chisel-forward --auth foo http://localhost:8080 3000:4000
2015/02/27 16:13:43 Connected to http://localhost:8080
2015/02/27 16:13:43 Proxy 0.0.0.0:3000 => 0.0.0.0:4000 enabled
```

And now we'll run the test again

```
#tab 4 (transfer test)
$ time curl -s "127.0.0.1:3000/largefile.bin" > /dev/null
       0.60 real         0.05 user         0.14 sys
```

Here, the same file was transferred in 0.6s

### Todo

* User file with list of whitelisted remotes
* TLS server configuration
* Expose a stats page for proxy throughput
* Tests along with benchmarks
